# capstone_2
This project is about data analysis and visualization about supermarket customers. 

This project starts by doing data exploration. In this process, number of rows and columns were identified; what are the columns about, identifying missing values, identifying outlier, identifying inconsistent terminologies and identifying data types. Second process is doing data cleaning. In this process, missing values were replaced with the median, outliers which were found was as as well replaced, inconsistent terminologies were handled as well. Subsequently, classification was done, for example creating generation cohort based on birth year, income based on income range and more. Once everything was done, data analysis and visualization were performed and actionable insights were produced. 

This project is useful because this can be a guideline or an example on doing data analysis and visualization. The processes, insights and recomendations are not restricted to this specific dataset but also relevant for others. 

This project works by opening a csv file which supposed to be stored in the same direction as the notebook and make it as a Data Frame. The overall processes should be tailored to each data.
